  #
  # A flex commerce RemoteAddress model
  #
  # This model provides access to the flex commerce remote addresses
  #
  # It is used much like an active record model.
  #
  # Examples:
  #
  #
  #
  #   # Fetching all addresses for a customer account
  #
  #   customer_account.addresses.all #fetches all addresses(actually the first page in case there are thousands)
  #
  #
  class RemoteAddress < FlexCommerceApi::ApiBase
